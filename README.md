## Xatrekak's Code Repo

This pages **_should_** contain links to all of my code projects. These projects are usually initiated to solve a current problem, or address workflow issues. Because of this the code usually contains no comments (I will try to get better about this) and is no longer maintained once it works. However, if any one files an issue against the I have no issues making changes or merging code.

Also warning I am very much a Network Engineer **NOT** a Software Engineer, any code found here comes with no warranties or promises that it wont immedidtly hard lock your computer.

### [Lab Loader](https://xatrekak.github.io/lab-loader/)

`This is a quick GUI app that I threw together to solve some work flow issues I had while stuying for my CCIE. Uses python to make and mount a disk image containing bootup files for the lab routers. Currently this method only works for the vIOS images and only on Linux.`

`At some point I will be adding Windows support via WSL (it requres GNU MTools). I will also be adding support for the CSR1000v which should have native windows support.`
